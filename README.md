This repository contains step-by-step instruction on how to compile a cross-toolchain targeting ARM architecture, with OSX as host. 
It also contains some of the pre-compiled toolchain for the embedded systems that I am working on. The pre-compiled toolchains are 
compiled using the .config files in config folder.
